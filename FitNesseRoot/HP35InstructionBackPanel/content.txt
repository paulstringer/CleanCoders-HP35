!1 Calculator Example
''The following examples are adapted from an original [[Calculator Example][http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?CalculatorExample]] created by Ward Cunningham at the site http://fit.c2.com.''

!4 The HP-35 was HP's first pocket calculator. It was introduced at a time when most calculators had only the four basic functions. The HP-35 was the first pocket calculator with transcendental functions, and the first with RPN.
!4 The following specifications have been derived from the instructions printed on the back of the calculator. (Image from http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp35.htm)

!5 The '''CHS''' first entry 'bug'
These examples show the quirky behaviour of chs on the HP-35 compared to later HP calculators when changing the sign of x AND as first entry for entering negative numbers.

The following is the actual behaviour of the HP-35 which was faithfully reproduced in the [[online simulator][https://www.hpmuseum.org/simulate/simulate.htm]].Â One assumes that Ward was actually using a later HP calculator to create this test rather than an actual HP-35.

|chs  |33 |-33|Maybe the user wanted to change X to +33, which it does. BUT number entry mode was stopped but CHS starts number entry mode again and so the next entry will also be negative!|

The following is an example of what is considered the more 'correct' behaviour of the chs function and at some point was changed on later HP calculators (and is the behaviour described in Wards example)

|33   |33 |0  |Starts number entry mode                                                         |

!***> '''EEX''' causes next entries to become the exponent of x. For negative expoinents '''CHS''' must precede digits.

The operational stack consistes of four registers (x, y, z and t). A fifth register (s) is used for constant storage.

The stack is automatically raised by an entry into x or by rcl unless the entry or rcl immediately follows clx, sto or enter.

Follwing any trig function z is duplicated into register t.

All angles are in degrees.

Example (2+3) * (4/5) / sin(30) * (4^-1.5) = 1.0000
